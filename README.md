This repository contains a quickly put-togther iPython notebook model of the
commute time across a proposed Bay Bridge bike path, as a function most
particularly of wind speed.  It includes evaluations of two types of wind
shielding: a tube enclosing the path in both directions, and a tube enclosing
the path just in the westbound direction.
